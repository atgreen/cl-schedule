* TODOs

+ Separate time-spec to an independent system:
  + Write a dedicated doc (with programmatic tests) for time-spec.
  + Allow =:mon= =:tue= =:wed= .. =:sun= in our time-spec.
+ Handle errors from schedules and prevent one failure from
  blocking others.
+ Write a doc for developers about how =cl-schedule= is implemented
  (e.g. its scheduler and dispatcher).
+ Merge dev to master (WARNING: this breaks API).

* Help Wanted

+ Implement a function that compiles usual cron-type time spec
  (e.g. =0 * * * *=) to a time spec defined in this project.
+ Implement test cases for the runtime. Currently, we only have
  test cases for the static parts of the system (e.g. time-spec,
  static schedules).
