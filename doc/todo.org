* Contributions

+ Implement a function that compiles usual cron-type time spec
  (e.g. =0 * * * *=) to a time spec defined in this project.
+ Allow =:mon= =:tue= =:wed= .. =:sun= in our time-spec. Document this
  new feature.
+ Implement test cases for the runtime. Currently, we only have
  test cases for the static parts of the system (e.g. time-spec,
  static schedules).
+ Resolve or come up with ideas for bugs in =doc/bugs.org=.
