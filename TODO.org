* TODOs

1. Extend so that it only emits warnings for skipped actions.
   Also create an option for the next call to be immediate if
   skipped.

2. Integrate with my =service= utils, and replace =systemd.timer=.

3. Better documentation. In particular, teaches the user how to
   express cron expressions like "*/5 7 12 * *" in this package.
