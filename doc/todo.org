** TODOs [3/4]

1. [X] Extend so that it only emits warnings for skipped actions.
   Also create an option for the next call to be immediate if
   skipped.

2. [X] Better documentation. In particular, teaches the user how
   to express cron expressions like =*/5 7 12 * *= in this package.

3. [X] Document =new/schedule-function= and merge it into
   =schedule-function=, without breaking backward compatibility.

4. [ ] Integrate with jin's =service= utilities, and replace
   =systemd.timer=.
