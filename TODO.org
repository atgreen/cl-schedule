* TODOs [1/3]

1. [X] Extend so that it only emits warnings for skipped actions.
   Also create an option for the next call to be immediate if
   skipped.

2. [ ] Better documentation. In particular, teaches the user how
   to express cron expressions like "*/5 7 12 * *" in this
   package.

3. [ ] Integrate with my =service= utils, and replace
   =systemd.timer=.
