	* released v0.0.3

	  1. The function #'schedule-function is extended. In this new
	version, it can choose to ignore all skipped jobs if any, and emit
	warnings.

	  2. The symbol 'now in the file clon.lisp is replaced by
	'init-time, which better describes its place. This breaks backward
	compatibility in user space mildly.

  	  3. Files are organized in a more modern and hierarchical way.

          4. A descriptive doc and more examples are given. In particular,
	it shows how clon is able to replace traditional cron managers.
